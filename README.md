# More Crystals

More Crystals is a Minecraft mod that adds a variety of new crystal types to the game. 

## Features

- Adds new crystal types such as Diamond and Redstone crystals.
- Budding crystal blocks that grow crystal buds over time.
- Crystal buds that grow into crystal clusters.
- Fully grown crystal clusters that can be harvested for resources.

## Crystal Deterioration

Budding crystal blocks have different quality levels that determine their durability:

- **Flawless**: Highest quality budding crystals that never deteriorate and will grow crystal buds indefinitely.
- **Flawed**: High quality budding crystals that can deteriorate to chipped quality after growing buds.
- **Chipped**: Medium quality budding crystals that can deteriorate to damaged quality after growing buds.
- **Damaged**: Lowest quality budding crystals that can deteriorate into regular crystal blocks after growing buds.

When a budding crystal grows a bud, there's a configurable chance that the budding block will deteriorate to the next lower quality level. The deterioration chance is controlled by the mod's configuration settings.
